N/A	NEP	27	Does not begin with a START (ATG) codon, but rather AAA. If this was unexpected, please check your annotations
N/A	NEP	44	Mid-sequence STOP codon. Please check your annotations for: (1) incorrect frame; or (2) incorrect starting or ending coordinates. A premature STOP codon may also indicate a pseudogene, for which piN vs. piS analysis may not be appropriate.
